However, you still need to mount a source first to listen to any music. Mounting sources \ud83d\udd17 To mount a source you need to use a client that can communicate with Icecast. For example, you can use liquidsoap for that: docker run savonet/liquidsoap:main 'output.icecast(host=\"localhost\", port=8000, password=\"hackme\", mount=\"radio.mp3\", %mp3, sine())' Now you should hear a sine wave at http://localhost:8000/radio.mp3 . Listening \ud83d\udd17 You can listen to any active mount point. If a mount point is called radio.mp3 then you can reach the stream at http://localhost:8000/radio.mp3 . Icecast is responsible for handling as many listeners as possible and making sure all of them get the live audio. Full usage \ud83d\udd17 $ ./start.sh --help Usage: ./start.sh [-p PORT] [-c CONFIG] [-u USER] -p, --port port to listen on (default: 8000) -c, --config config file path (default: /etc/icecast2/icecast.xml) -u, --user user to run icecast with, should be in a group with the same name (default: icecast)","title":"Usage"},{"location":"usage/#usage","text":"To start the server cd into src and run: ./start.sh The server will run on http://localhost:8000 .
